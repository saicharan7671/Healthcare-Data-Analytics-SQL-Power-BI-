📊 Healthcare Data Analytics Project
🏥 Overview

This project analyzes healthcare data (hospitals, doctors, patients, diseases, and treatment outcomes) using SQL for data cleaning & transformation and Power BI for visualization.
The goal is to provide insights into hospital performance, patient demographics, doctor specialization, and treatment effectiveness.

⚙️ Tech Stack

SQL → Data cleaning, transformations, aggregations

Power BI → Dashboards and visual storytelling

Excel/CSV → Dataset handling

📂 Dataset

Patient Data → ID, age, gender, city, admission type (IPD/OPD/Emergency), payment mode, disease, treatment outcome

Hospital Data → ID, name, city, specialization, revenue, doctors

Doctor Data → ID, specialization, experience level

(Dataset is simulated for learning purposes.)

🔑 Key Insights

Patient Demographics: 250K patients analyzed; majority between 20–40 years, gender split ~48% male, ~48% female.

Hospital Performance: Top 5 hospitals contributed the highest revenue (~135M+ INR).

Doctor Analysis: Balanced distribution across specializations; ~38% were experienced-level doctors.

Treatment Outcomes: ~70% OPD cases, ~25% IPD, with majority showing recovery or improvement.

Payment Trends: Card and UPI payments dominated; insurance penetration ~22%.

Top Diseases: Depression, Migraine, Arthritis, Gastritis, and Tuberculosis were most common.
